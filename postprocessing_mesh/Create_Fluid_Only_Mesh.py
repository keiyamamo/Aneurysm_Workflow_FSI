# This script creates a fluid-only mesh in h5 format from a specified mesh. Currently, it only runs in serial (not parallel)
# due to the "SubMesh" function used in fenics. This mesh is later used in  the "postprocessing_fenics" scripts
# If the input mesh is not refined (save_deg = 2 mesh) the script also creates 
# "boundaries" in the h5 file, which are used for calculating flow rates. 
#
#    TO DO:
#    -Add boundary creation in other meshing scripts
#    -Add domain creation in all meshing scripts
